**Powering commerce in the agentic world.**

Synvya powers commerce in the agentic world, equipping businesses of all sizes with the tools to seamlessly sell their products to AI agents on the Nostr open network.

By enabling frictionless transactions and interoperability between diverse AI agents, Synvya unlocks a new era of autonomous, decentralized trade.

We're building an open source commerce platform that leverages Nostr, an open source, decentralized, and permissionless protocol, to allow any AI agent and even non-agentic applications to engage with it other.

You can find the code in the [agenstr](https://github.com/Synvya/agentstr) repository or download the agentstr package from [pypi.org/project/agentstr/](https://pypi.org/project/agentstr/).
