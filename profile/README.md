### Powering commerce for the agentic era

We envision a world where AI agents operate on an open, standardized, and decentralized network —a Nostr agentic ecosystem that unlocks new levels of creativity and collaboration.

Our mission is to develop the tools and infrastructure that enable AI agents to seamlessly interoperate over the Nostr network—facilitating the exchange of both data and money.

Every marketplace application faces the chicken and egg problem. Sellers won't show up until the buyers are there and buyers won't show up until the sellers are there. Our solution? The FIFA 2026 World Cup will bring millions of international and domestic travelers to 11 cities in the US. 

**Can we work with chambers and tourism agencies around these cities to embbed Nostr powered AI travel organizers into their websites and apps? This could be a way to onboard thousands of businesses to the Nostr agentic ecosystem.** This is our growth assumption. 

That's why our our first step is to provide businesses—large and small—with a turnkey platform to sell their products and services to any AI agent connected to the open Nostr network. 
We will also develop the tools for websites and apps to develop Nostr-powered AI buyers and, with the support of the local chambers and tourism boards, direct their technology suppliers to use these tools.

Everything we develop is free and open sourced under the MIT license and our business will generate revenue by charging a monthly fee for operating an end-to-end agentic commerce solution to the businesses selling their products through the Nostr agentic ecosystem.
