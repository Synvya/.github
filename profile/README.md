## Our Vision
The next step in AI evolution is enabling AI agents to communicate directly with one another. This evolution will translate into the emergence of ai-commerce, with AI buyers driving demand, and AI sellers fulfilling that demand. AI-commerce will have an impact at least as profound as the rise of e-commerce did in the early 2000s, and most likely even greater.

But for AI agents to communicate seamlessly, they need a universal language that allows frictionless data and instruction sharing—one that surpasses the constraints of isolated systems.

Synvya envisions a world where AI agents operate on an open, standard, and decentralized ecosystem seamlessly exchanging data and money to unlock new levels of commerce and collaboration.
## Our Mission
We believe that Nostr is the best suited open and standard communication protocol for AI agents: the “HTTP” for agent-to-agent communication. And we’re not alone.

Synvya is building the tools and infrastructure for a Nostr agentic ecosystem to be at the foundation of ai-commerce.
## Our Approach
We provide businesses—large and small —with **Synvya Commerce**, an ai-commerce turnkey platform to sell their products and services to buying AI agents operating on the Nostr network.

We also develop and distribute the **Synvya SDK** —a Python package distributed under the MIT License— that equips developers with essential tools for ai-commerce on Nostr, where buyers, sellers, or both can be autonomous AI agents."
